# Connecting to Databases with JupySQL

Learn how to connect to various databases using JupySQL in this tutorial. JupySQL is a Jupyter Notebook extension that allows you to execute SQL queries directly in your notebook cells. We'll show you how to establish connections, connect securely, and use existing `sqlalchemy.engine.Engine` instances.

## Establishing a connection 

### Connect with SQLAlchemy

Connection strings follow the SQLAlchemy URL standard. 

Here are some example connection strings for various databases:

```
mysql+pymysql://scott:tiger@localhost/foo
oracle://scott:tiger@127.0.0.1:1521/sidname
sqlite://
sqlite:///foo.db
mssql+pyodbc://username:password@host/database?driver=SQL+Server+Native+Client+11.0
```

**Note:** `mysql` and `mysql+pymysql` connections (and perhaps others) don't read your client character set information from `.my.cnf.` You need to specify it in the connection string:

```
mysql+pymysql://scott:tiger@localhost/foo?charset=utf8
```

For an `impala` connection with [`impyla`](https://github.com/cloudera/impyla) for HiveServer2, you need to disable autocommit:

```
%config SqlMagic.autocommit=False
%sql impala://hserverhost:port/default?kerberos_service_name=hive&auth_mechanism=GSSAPI
```

Additionally, note that autocommit features for `pytds` connections are disabled.

Connection arguments not whitelisted by SQLALchemy can be provided as
a flag with (-a|--connection_arguments)the connection string as a JSON string. See [SQLAlchemy Args](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html#custom-dbapi-args)


```
%sql --connection_arguments {"timeout":10,"mode":"ro"} sqlite:// SELECT * FROM work;
%sql -a '{"timeout":10, "mode":"ro"}' sqlite:// SELECT * from work;
```

## Connecting to Databases

Check out our guide for connecting to a database:

- [PostgreSQL](integrations/postgres-connect)
- [ClickHouse](integrations/clickhouse)
- [MariaDB](integrations/mariadb)
- [MindsDB](integrations/mindsdb)
- [MSSQL](integrations/mssql)
- [MySQL](integrations/mysql)
- [QuestDB](integrations/db-api)

## Secure Connections


**It is highly recommended** that you do not pass plain credentials.

```{code-cell} ipython3
%load_ext sql
```

### DSN connections

```{tip} 
It is recommended to use config file for connection as it's more secure and do not expose credentials.
```

To ensure the security of your credentials, you can store connection information in a configuration file, under a section name chosen to  refer to your database.

For instance, suppose you have a configuration file named _dsn.ini_ that contains the following section:

```
[DB_CONFIG_1] 
drivername=postgres 
host=my.remote.host 
port=5433 
database=mydatabase 
username=myuser 
password=1234
```

then you can establish a connection to your database by running the following commands:

```
%config SqlMagic.dsn_filename='./dsn.ini'
%sql --section DB_CONFIG_1 
```

+++

### Building connection strings

One option is to use `getpass`, type your password, build your connection string and pass it to `%sql`:

+++

```python
from getpass import getpass

password = getpass()
connection_string = f"postgresql://user:{password}@localhost/database"
%sql $connection_string
```

+++

### Using `DATABASE_URL`

+++

Alternatively, set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, and `%sql` will automatically load it. You can do this either by setting the environment variable from your terminal or in your notebook:

```python
from getpass import getpass
from os import environ

password = getpass()
environ["DATABASE_URL"] = f"postgresql://user:{password}@localhost/database"
```

```python
# without any args, %sql reads from DATABASE_URL
%sql
```

+++

## Using an existing `sqlalchemy.engine.Engine`

Use an existing `Engine` by passing the variable name to `%sql`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
from sqlalchemy.engine import create_engine
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
engine = create_engine("sqlite://")
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
df = pd.DataFrame({"x": range(5)})
df.to_sql("numbers", engine)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%load_ext sql
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%sql engine
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
%%sql
SELECT * FROM numbers
```

## Custom Connection

```{versionadded} 0.7.1
```

If you are using a database not supported by SQLAlchemy but follows the [DB API 2.0 specification](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/), you can still use JupySQL.

```{note}
We currently support `%sql`, `%sqlplot`, and the `ggplot` API when using custom connection. However, please be advised that there may be some features/functionalities that won't be fully compatible with JupySQL.
```

For this example we'll use `QuestDB` which is not supported by SQLAlchemy.

Initialize a connection, QuestDB works with the psycopg2 driver.

```{note}
Before running the following commands, please make sure you have QuestDB running locally. If you don't have it installed, you can install it via Docker by following the instructions [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/questdb/questdb).
```

```
import psycopg2 as pg
engine = pg.connect(
    "dbname='qdb' user='admin' host='127.0.0.1' port='8812' password='quest'"
)
```

Connect to JupySQL with our custom connection

```
%load_ext sql
%sql engine
```

For a full example please see [QuestDB tutorial](integrations/db-api.ipynb)

## Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated how to leverage the power of JupySQL in Jupyter Notebooks for connecting to and interacting with databases. We covered key aspects such as:

- Connection strings for different databases following SQLAlchemy URL standards.
- Connecting to databases using the %sql magic command.
- Securely connecting to databases by avoiding plain credentials and using methods like getpass and DATABASE_URL environment variable.
- Using DSN connections for managing connection information in configuration files.
- Utilizing existing sqlalchemy.engine.Engine instances for database connections.

With these techniques, you can confidently manage connections to your databases while ensuring security and flexibility. JupySQL provides a convenient and powerful way to execute SQL queries and analyze data within Jupyter Notebooks.
