# Jupyter Magic

One may be unfamiliar with the commands prefixed with `%` used in this instruction. Here is a detailed description of this command and its usage. 

## Definition of Jupyter Magic

Magics are specific to and provided by the IPython kernel. Some common usage of magic functions are: running external code files, timing code execution, and loading IPython Extensions. 

Suppose execute.py is a python code file

```
%run execute.py
%timeit L = [n ** 2 for n in range(1000)] (Timing executions -- will return 1000 loops, best of 3: 325 Âµs per loop)
```

In our code above, we use **%load_ext** to load an IPython extension by its module name, `sql`, and then directly use the extension by using `%sql`.

```
load an IPython extension by its module name.
%load_ext sql 
```

## Line Magic VS Cell Magic

**Line magics**, which are denoted by a single % prefix and operate on a single line of input, and **cell magics**, which are denoted by a double %% prefix and operate on multiple lines of input. 

For example, for the code above, **%sql** is a line magic, and **%%sql** is a code magic.
